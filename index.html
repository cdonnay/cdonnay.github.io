                    <p>Chris Donnay is currently the lab manager for  
                      <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mggg.org" target="_blank">the Data and Democracy Lab</a>
                      at Cornell University. 
                      As lab manager, he has extensive experience translating  
                      real-world problems into technical solutions for non-profits and advocacy groups.
                      He has a knack for communicating high-level mathematics to a wide range
                      of audiences, with a focus on clarity and actionable insights.
                      He got his PhD in mathematics from the Ohio State University, 
                      where he studied data science, probability, and statistical modeling, 
                      with applications to redistricting and voting.
                      Chris also holds a Master's of Science in education from the University of Pennsylvania, 
                      where he was a high school math and computer science teaching fellow.

                    <p>
                      In 2024, Michigan's legislative maps were struck down as being in violation of the Voting Rights Act in
                      the Michigan Supreme Court case Agee v. Benson.
                      When it came time to create new maps, the advocacy group Voters Not Politicians
                      asked us to help them model ways to balance different metrics of partisanship with the Voting Rights Act.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Chris created a model of redistricting plans in Michigan, collecting data from 
                      public and private sources in order to produce maps that balanced different metrics of partisanship
                      with the Voting Rights Act. 
                      The results of our study influenced the creation of the new legislative maps 
                    used as a remedy for the case.</p>

                    <p>In November of 2024, Portland, OR held their first city council election
                      with a single-transferable-vote (STV) system, electing 12 council members
                      across 4 districts. There was concern about how STV might impact the ability 
                      of communities of color to participate in the process.

                      developing visualizations with <code>matplotlib</code>, and explaining the code in a <code>Jupyter</code> notebook. 
                      The results showed that dominant media
                      narratives about ballot errors by people of color were misguided, and that STV actually 
                      helped increase representation of communities of color.

                            Candidate pairs (i,j) that are more green show a kind of "mutual boosting",
                            where if candidate j appears on a ballot, candidate i is more likely to appear on a ballot as well.
                            This reveals a slate of candidates (Avalos, Routh, Dunphy, and Ender) who all
                            mutually boost.

                    <h4>Predicting Bake Off Winners</h4>
                    <p>
                      As part of the Erdős Institute Data Science Bootcamp, Chris and his team
                      trained supervised learning models using
                      <code></code>scikit-learn</code>—regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and Naive Bayes—
                      to predict winners and uncover key
                      drivers of success in the Great British Baking Show. 
                      Ultimately, they found that the most important factor in predicting winners
                      was performance in the technical challenges (receiving a handshake
                      from Paul Hollywood turned out to be far less predictive than hoped!).

                      to a panel of industry experts, 
                      who specifically highlighted the team's clear communication of modeling 
                      limitations and results. They were awarded first place.</p>

                    districting plans. After many years of faithful service, Districtr 1.0 was retired and replaced with Districtr 2.0.
                    Districtr is used by many localities as their official submission tool for the redistricting process.

                    Together with his team, Chris ensured that the app was robust and scalable,
                    that there was smooth communication between the dev team and the PI,
                    and that the app was easy to use and understand.

                <h4>3:1 Nesting Rules in Redistricting</h4>
                <p>
                  A nesting rule is a rule that requires that a senate district be composed of adjacent house districts.
                  Ohio and Wisconsin have 3:1 nesting rules (3 house districts per senate district).
                  How does this affect the space of feasible plans? How does this affect the ability of a map-maker to gerrymander?

                </p>

                <p>
                  Chris implemented a novel algorithm for generating plans that satisfy a 3:1 nesting rule
                  in Python using Markov chain methods. He validated his model using different mixing heuristics
                  and statistical tests. He found that while 3:1 nesting has little impact on the 
                  number of seats won by a party in comparison to unnested plans, it does 
                  curtail the impact of gerrymandered house maps and the ability to gerrymander more broadly.

                    <p>While much of Chris' work has been focused on applications of statistical models
                      and data science, his PhD is technically in theoretical mathematics, and he has a particular interest in combinatorics.
                      This project was part of his PhD dissertation, and is set to appear in the American Mathematical Monthly,
                      which is a prestigious journal known for its high standards of writing.

                      How many ways are there to redistrict an n×n grid into n districts? How does this grow with n? 
                      What can this tell us about the shape of a typical district? This mathematical research 
                      explores the combinatorial properties of redistricting and their implications for 
                      understanding gerrymandering. We find that the number of maps grows exponentially
                    in n^2, and that a random districting plan is likly to be highly non-compact.</p>
